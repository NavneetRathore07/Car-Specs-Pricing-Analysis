# Car Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project was completed as part of my internship as a Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd. The project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about various car models. The objective is to perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights from the data.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- Transform and engineer new features to enhance the analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
- Visualize the data using various plots and charts for better understanding.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate values or dropping them.
   - Removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

2. **Data Transformation and Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new columns such as car age and HP Category.
   - Categorized numerical columns like 'Engine HP' into bins.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
   - Visualized the distribution of prices, the relationship between engine HP and price, and the distribution of various car makes.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar plots, scatter plots, count plots, and heatmaps to present the findings.

## Key Findings

- Identified the distribution and trends of car prices, engine HP, and MPG across different car makes.
- Discovered patterns and relationships between various features such as engine HP and MSRP.
- Visualized the distribution of transmission types and their counts, excluding unknown transmissions for better clarity.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into the car dataset, helping to understand the trends and patterns in car prices, engine performance, and fuel efficiency. The project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in extracting meaningful information from raw data.
